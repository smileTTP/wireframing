This project is to explore wireframing using Figma to deepen my knowledge in UI/UX design.
# the key elements found in a wireframe
1. Layout Structure

What it is: The overall arrangement of sections on a page (header, footer, sidebars, main content area).

Why it matters: Establishes the visual hierarchy and helps users understand where to look first.

Example: In a hotel booking system’s homepage, the layout might place a search bar prominently in the center, with a navigation menu on top and promotional banners below. This guides users to perform searches before exploring secondary content.

2. Navigation

What it is: Links, menus, and pathways that let users move between pages or sections.

Why it matters: Ensures the site or app is intuitive and easy to explore.

Example: A top navigation bar might include Home, Search Hotels, My Bookings, Checkout, helping users quickly jump to the desired section without confusion.

3. Content Placement

What it is: The positioning of text, images, buttons, and forms within the layout.

Why it matters: Guides the user’s attention and emphasizes important actions. Good placement prevents clutter and improves readability.

Example: On the checkout page, placing the booking summary on the left and the payment form on the right ensures users can review their details while entering payment info, reducing mistakes.

4. Functionality (Interactive Elements)

What it is: The buttons, forms, search fields, dropdowns, and other interactive parts that let users perform actions.

Why it matters: Defines how the product works in practice, not just how it looks.

Example: A “Confirm Booking” button at the end of checkout triggers the payment process, while a filter dropdown on the search page lets users narrow hotel results by price, location, or rating.

# Types of Wireframes
Wireframes come in different types, each serving specific purposes and offering varying levels of detail. The main types of wireframes are:

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes (Lo-Fi)
Low-fidelity wireframes are basic and minimalist representations of the user interface. They focus on the layout, structure, and content placement without delving into visual design details.

They are typically created using simple shapes, placeholders, and lines to represent different elements and interactions. They are useful in the early stages of the design process for quick ideation, iteration, and validating the information architecture and user flow.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes (Hi-Fi)
High-fidelity wireframes are detailed and visually refined representations of the user interface. They closely resemble the final product’s visual design.

Hi-fi wireframes include specific design elements such as colours, fonts, and more accurate representations of content and images. They are useful for presenting a more realistic version of the user interface to stakeholders, conducting user testing with a visually representative prototype, and guiding developers during implementation.
